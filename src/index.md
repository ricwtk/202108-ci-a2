# Instructions 

## Assignment tasks

1. The task of this assignment is to first, **construct a neural network** on a real-world dataset, and second, discuss how you may apply two types of **hybrid intelligent systems** as modification to this neural network with the dataset.
    1. Choose a real-world dataset that is available online. You can obtain your dataset from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or other sources that you can find.
    2. Understand the dataset. 
    3. Identify the purpose of applying a neural network on the dataset. 
    4. Discuss the neural network architecture to be constructed. 
    5. Construct, train, and test the neural network on the dataset. 
    6. Discuss the results. 
    7. Select two types of hybrid intelligent systems. 
    8. Discuss the purpose of modifying the neural network to be the hybrid intelligent systems.
    9. Describe how you would implement the hybrid intelligent systems.

    !!! note ""
        You do not have to implement the hybrid intelligent systems in your code.

2. Prepare a report that contains
    1. the source of the dataset, 
    2. the description of the dataset,
    3. the purpose of applying a neural network (what do you want to achieve with a neural network?),
    4. the architecture of the neural network (how many layers of neurons you are using? Are you using a feedforward or a recurrent?),
    5. the justification onthe architecture (why do you choose the different parameters of the architecture?),
    6. the implementation of the training of the neural network (how do you split the data? how do you determine the stopping criteria?),
    7. the discussion on the results (what do the results tell you about the neural network?)
    8. the two types of hybrid intelligent systems that you have selected as modification to the neural network,
    9. the purpose of the modification with the hybrid intelligent systems (what can the hybrid systems do that the neural network cannot?), and
    10. the description on how the hybrid intelligent systems are applied in the dataset.
    
    !!! note ""
        Example questions are provided to help you to decide what to include in the report. They are not exhaustive and should not limit your content.
